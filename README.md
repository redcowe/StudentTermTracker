<h1>Inventory Management System</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project was part of my coursework at Western Governors University. I was required to create a mobile app that met the requirements of the rubric and the following is the end product. The app uses a local SQLite database along with an ORM to create persistency in the application. Below a video walkthrough and screenshots of the application can be found.
