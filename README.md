<h1>Inventory Management System</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a simple inventory management system that was part of my coursework at WGU. The app does everything in memory and doesn't implement a database. Users can add, delete and modify parts and products using the buttons beneath the respective tables. 
Delete and Search functionalities are the exact same for both Products and Parts. The only exception being when a product has parts associated with it.
